## Task
- [x] Image Gallery Implementation: Develop an image gallery using the Unsplash API.

plain CSS or TailwindCSS for styling. Preference will be given to the use of
TailwindCSS, considering our organisational standards.
- [x] Homepage Design: Create a homepage that includes a search bar. This page should
also feature a random background image sourced from the Unsplash API, which
changes with each page reload.
- [x] Search Functionality: Implement a feature where a search input leads to a display of
results in a grid masonry layout, similar to the search results presentation on
Unsplash.
- [x] "Starred" Images Feature: Incorporate a feature that allows users to "star" or bookmark their favourite images.
- [x] Starred Images Page:
    - [x] Create a dedicated page within the application where users can view all their
starred images.
    - [x] This page should maintain the same aesthetic and layout as the main image
gallery but exclusively display the userâ€™s starred images.
    - [x] Ensure that the starring mechanism is intuitive and accessible, allowing users
to easily add or remove images from their starred collection. (Optional/Bonus)# splash
